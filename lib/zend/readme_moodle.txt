Description of Zend framework 1.9.4 import into Moodle
Please note the zend framework is severly crippled - everything not needed in /webservice/* is removed.

Do not use outside of our /webservice/* or mnet !!


Changes:
* lots of files removed
* small fix to error reporting in reflection (MDL-21460, ZF-8980)
* regular expression fix in reflection (committed upstream, will be in 1.10) (MDL-21461, ZF-6996)
