<h1>Blackboard V6+ files</h1>

<p>This module can import questions saved in Blackboard's export
format. It provides limited support for Blackboard Version 6 and
7. It relies on XML functions being compiled into your PHP. You
must upload the zip file exported from Blackboard.</p>

<p>Note that this format only imports the main data file from 
the zip. Any other data (e.g. images) is ignored.</p>
