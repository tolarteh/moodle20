<div id="emoticons">##emoticons_html##</div>
<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>When writing online, it can sometimes difficult to express emotion with plain text.
These little icons can help.</p>

<p>To insert these icons in your text: just click the icon above, or type the
associated text code directly in your text.</p>

<p>Note that the codes themselves are like little pictures - just turn your
head to the left when looking at them</p>
