<h1>Blackboard (POOL) Files</h1>

<p>This module can import questions saved in Blackboard's "POOL" type export 
format. This is generally for Blackboard versions 5 and earlier although
many other quiz packages use this as their "Blackboard" export format. </p>

<p>
To use this first unpack the exported zip file and provide Moodle 
with the appropriate .dat file. Do not try to import the zip file directly</p>

<p>Note that this version <strong>does not</strong> work with Blackboard
Version 6 and newer.</p>
