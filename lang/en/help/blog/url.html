<h1>URL</h1>

<p>Almost every blog has the ability to publish its contents to the world in the form of an RSS URL. Consult your external blog's configuration
and documentation if you are unsure of what this URL should look like. When you have it, enter it in this field. Once you submit the form,
your link will be checked to see if it is a valid URL.</p>
