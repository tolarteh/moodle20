<h1>Missing Word Format</h1>

<p>This format only supports multiple choice questions and
short answer question, depending on the number of answers. One
answer generates a short answer question, two or more answers
generate a multiple choice question.
Each answer is separated with a tilde (~), and the correct answer is 
prefixed with an equals sign (=).  Here is an example of a multiple
choice question:</p>

<blockquote><p>As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology 
~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is an example of a short answer question:</p>

<blockquote><p>As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
 we become students of {=anatomy and physiology},
