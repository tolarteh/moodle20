<h1>Attachments for posts</h1>

<p>You can optionally attach one or more files (the number depends 
   on the forum settings) to any post in the forums.</p>

<p>This can useful when you want to share a picture or a 
   word processing document, for example.</p>

<p>Your files can be of any type, however it is highly recommended
   that the file is named using standard 3-letter internet 
   suffixes such as .doc for a Word document, .jpg or .png 
   for an image, and so on.  This will make it easier for others 
   to download and view your attachment in their browsers.</p>
