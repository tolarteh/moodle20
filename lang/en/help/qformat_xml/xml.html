<h1>"Moodle XML" format</h1>

<p>This Moodle specific format imports quiz questions that have previously been
exported in the same format. The format is straightforward and is best demonstrated
by exporting a category in the Moodle XML format. The XML format is capabable of 
importing image files.
</p>

<p>Optional questiontype plugins can extend this format.</p>

<h3>Category Switching</h3>

<p>You can insert a special dummy question into the XML file to specify
the category path into which the following questions will be inserted.
If the category or categories do not exist they will be created. Note that
the <b>from file:</b> option must be ticked on the option page or this code
will be ignored completely. You can switch categories in the xml file as often as you
wish.</p>

<p>An example of the format is as follows:</p>

<pre>
&lt;question type="category"&gt;
    &lt;category&gt;
        tom/dick/harry
    &lt;/category&gt;
&lt;/question&gt;
</pre>
