<h1>Activity completion condition</h1>

<p>
You can set a condition based on whether the user has completed another 
activity.
</p>

<p>
This feature uses the completion options that have been configured for the
other activity. You can choose whether the activity must be complete, 
incomplete, complete and passed, or complete and failed. The final two 
options only work if you use grade-based completion and set a pass mark on
the grade item. (Please look at the documentation for activity completion
if this is unclear.)
</p>

<p>
You can add more than one completion condition. All conditions must be met in 
order for the activity to appear.
