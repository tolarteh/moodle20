<h1>Unavailable activity display</h1>

<p>
When an activity is unavailable due to the restrictions in this box, there are 
two possibilities:
</p>

<ol>
<li> The activity displays to users, but as greyed-out text instead of a link.
  Informational text below the activity indicates when, or under what 
  conditions, it will become available.</li>
<li> The activity does not display to users at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In both cases, once the activity becomes available, it displays as normal.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Users with the 'view hidden activities' capability can still see 
  unavailable activities, regardless of this setting. The informational text
  always appears to them.</li>
<li>This option does not affect the standard 'visibility' option (also controlled
  by the eye icon). You can still use this icon to quickly and completely hide 
  any activity from students, for example if you find a problem with the 
  activity.</li>
</ul>
