<h1>Grade condition</h1>

<p>
You can specify a condition on any grade in the course: the full course grade,
the grade for any activity, or a custom grade that you create manually.
</p>

<p>
You can enter either a minimum value (&ge;), a maximum value (&lt;), both, or 
neither. The activity will only appear if the student has a value for the 
specified grade, and if it falls within any specified number range.
</p> 

<p>
You can add more than one grade condition. All conditions must be met in order
for the activity to appear.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The range numbers can be fractional (with up to five decimal places) if 
    necessary. </li>
<li>Be careful with the maximum value; if the maximum is 7, a student who 
    scores exactly 7 will not see the activity. You could set it to 7.01 if
    you really wanted to include 7.</li>
<li>If creating several different activities that appear according to grade 
    ranges, use the same number for the maximum of one activity, and the minimum
    of the next. For example, you might create one activity with a maximum of 7
    and another with a minimum of 7. The first would appear to everyone scoring
    between 0 and 6.99999, and the second would appear to everyone scoring 7.00000
    to 10. This guarantees that everyone with a grade will see one or other.</li>
</ul>
