<h1>Available dates</h1>

<p>
Using the 'Only available from' and 'Only available until end' dates, you can make 
an activity appear or disappear. The activity is only shown to students from the
'available from' date, and it disappears after the 'available until end' date. Students 
cannot access it outside those times, even if they guess the URL.
</p>

<p>
By default both dates are disabled, meaning that the activity is available at
any time (as long as the student can access the course).
</p> 

<ul>
<li> If you choose to show information about an activity that is unavailable,
  then before the 'available from' date, students will see the activity 
  greyed-out, with informational text about the date that it appears.</li>
<li> The activity completely vanishes at midnight on the 'available to end' date, even if 
  you've chosen to show information.</li>
<li> Setting 'Visible' to 'Hide' overrides these settings. If you set 'Visible'
  to 'Hide', the activity is never available regardless of date.</li>
</ul>
