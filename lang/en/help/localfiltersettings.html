<h1>Filter settings</h1>

<p>This page lets you turn filters on or off in a particular part of the site.
This page only gives you access to those filters that the Administrator has
enabled.</p>

<p>Some filters may also let you set local settings, in which case there will be
a 'Settings' link next to their name.</p>
