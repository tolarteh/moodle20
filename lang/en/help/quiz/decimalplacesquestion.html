<h1>Decimal places in question grades</h1>

<p>You can choose a different precision to use when displaying the grades for
individual quesitons, as opposed to the overall quiz score. For example,
you may wish the final score for the quiz to be rounded to the nearest
whole number, while still having fractional scores for individual questions.</p>
