<h1>Exporting questions from a Category</h1>

<p>This function allows you to export a complete category (and all its
   subcategories) of questions to a text file. </p> 

<p>Please note that in many file formats some information is lost
   when the questions are exported. This is because many formats do
   not possess all the features that exist in Moodle questions. You should 
   not expect to export and import questions and for them to be
   identical. Also some question types may not export at all.
   You are advised to check exported data before using
   it in a production environment.</p>

<p>A number of file formats are supported. See in the individual help files
and the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/question/import">Moodle Docs</a>
for details.</p>


<p>Import and Export formats are a pluggable resource. Other optional formats may be available in the
   Modules and Plugins database.</p>
