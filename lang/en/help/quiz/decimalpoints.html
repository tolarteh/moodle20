<h1>Decimal places</h1>

<p>By using this setting you can select the number of digits that should be
shown after the decimal point when displaying student scores or grades.
For example choosing '0' means the displayed grades will be rounded to integers.</p>

<p>This setting only effects the display of grades. It does not affect the grades
stored in the database, nor the internal calculations, which are always carried
out to full precision.</p>
