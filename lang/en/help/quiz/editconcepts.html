<h1>The basic ideas of quiz-making</h1>

<p>The main concepts you need to understand while creating quizzes and the
questions they contain are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quiz, divided into pages</li>
    <li>The question bank, which stores all the questions organised into categories</li>
    <li>Random questions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can think of a <strong>quiz</strong> as being like
traditional pen-and-paper quiz (or exam or test). It contains questions.
You can arrange the questions in a quiz into several <strong>pages</strong>
or you can keep them all on one page. As you create the questions, and add them
to the quiz, you also set up how the questions are graded
(or marked). This is like the mark-scheme for a traditional quiz.</p>

<p>When you create questions, they are stored in the <strong>question
bank</strong>. In the question bank you can create <strong>categories</strong>,
which are similar to folders on your computer. You can use them to create a
hierarchy for organising your questions, for example, by topic. Even if you
create and add a question directly into the quiz, a copy is automatically stored in
the question bank too. </p>
<p>You can use <strong>random questions</strong> so that different students get
different questions, or so that one student gets different questions each time
they attempt the quiz. For example, this can reduce cheating by making it harder
for students to copy from each other. When a student starts an attempt at the
quiz, the random question will be replaced by an actual question, picked at
random from a certain category in the question bank. You create a random 
question by adding the selection of questions you want to a question bank 
category, and then adding a random question for that category into the quiz.</p>
