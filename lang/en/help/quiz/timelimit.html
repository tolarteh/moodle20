<p align="center"><strong>Time limit</strong></p>

<p>By default, quizzes do not have a time limit, which allows students as much
time as they need to complete the quiz, providing they finish before any close
date.</p>

<p>If you do specify a time limit, a countdown clock appears on-screen, and the
quiz is automatically submitted when the time runs out. With a time limit, the
student must submit their attempt before the time limit, or they will not
receive a grade.</p>
