<h1>Importing new questions</h1>

<p>This function allows you to import questions from 
   external text files, uploaded through a form,
   or by choosing a suitable file already in the
   course Files area.  </p>

<h2>A note about character encodings</h2>

<p>If your file contains non-ascii characters then it must use UTF-8 encoding. 
   You may be able to select or convert to UTF-8 using your favourite editor,
   or it may be an option in the exporting software. 
   Be particularly cautious with files generated by Microsoft Office applications,
   as these commonly use special encoding which will not be handled correctly.
   XML based import formats will be handled
   automatically provided your Moodle server is running PHP 5.</p> 

<p>A number of file formats are supported. See in the individual help files
and the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/question/import">Moodle Docs</a>
for details.</p>


<p>Import and Export formats are a pluggable resource. Other optional formats may be available in the
   Modules and Plugins database.</p>
