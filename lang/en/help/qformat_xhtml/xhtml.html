<h1>XHTML</h1>

<p>Exports the category as a single page of 'strict' XHTML. Each question is clearly placed in its own
&lt;div&gt; tag. If you want to use this page as-is, you will need to at least edit the &lt;form&gt; tag at the
start of the &lt;body&gt; section to provide a suitable action (eg, a 'mailto').</p>
